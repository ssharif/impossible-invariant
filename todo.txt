* Move matrix results to §2
* Deal with Corollary 4.2
* Show that ψ_A descends to a map on moduli in general
  ie check what the U, V do to the principal polarization
* Prove 5.7.
* for E/C x E/alpha*C = E/C x E/beta*C, see https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs13348-010-0029-1.pdf. Proposition 65 (use n=1 case to bootstrap n=2 without computing the lattices directly)
** Show that I(α-tilde) = χ(α)
